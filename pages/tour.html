				<h1>A Tour of Fract</h1>
				<h2 id="hello_world">Hello World!</h2>
				<div class="code" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">print('Hello World!')</div>
				Fract has built-in functions, you can print a value with the <x class="inline_code"> print </x> function, which is one of the built-in functions.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
				All developers strive to make their code understandable and readable. Sometimes it may be necessary to make a statement or make a note.
				Comments serve a variety of purposes, such as commenting, annotating, and taking notes in code.
				It is a convenient tool to understand the algorithm when you look at it later or when a different developer looks at it.
				<h3>Singleline Comment</h3>
				<x class="inline_code"> # </x> is used for singline comments. The rest of the line from the point of use is marked as a comment.
				<br>
				<div class="warn">
					If you want to show it as a comment, a space or similar must be after
					<x class="inline_code"> # </x> otherwise it will be accepted as a macro.
				</div>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;"># Comment
#Macro</div>
				<h3>Multiline Comment</h3>
				<x class="inline_code"> #> ... <# </x> are used for multiline comments. It accepts the part from opening to closing as a comment.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">#>
    Say hello to name.
    x = Name.
<#
func Hello(name)
    print('Hello ' + name)
end</div>
				<div class="tip">
					It is always advantageous to use a single line comment because the lexer it gives free space to the memory by deleting these comments from the lines that are read.
				</div>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="statement_terminator">Statement Terminator</h2>
				It is available in many programming languages ​​and is generally mandated. Fract does not enforce this, but supports its use.
				If you wanted to continue the line, it would be freedom-restricting not having that option.
				Therefore, you can write multiple statements on a single line by separating the statements with the statement terminator.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">print(5); print(2)</div>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="data_types">Data Types</h2>
				Data types are the types provided so that the Fract understands what to do with that data.
				<h3>Integer</h3>
				It is an integer, no decimal value.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var integer = 890</div>
				<br>
				You can give an integer value in hexadecimal format by starting with <x class="inline_code"> 0x </x>.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">var integer = 0xAA90F # 43664</div>
				<h3>Double</h3>
				It is a double, can contains decimal value.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var double = 400.2387</div>
				<h3>String</h3>
				They are strings of characters, they hold text data.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var string = 'Fract!'; var str = "Fract!"</div>
				String provides a escape sequences and represents with <x class="inline_code"> \ </x>.
				<h4>Escape Sequences</h4>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>\\</td>
						<td>Backslash.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\'</td>
						<td>Single quote.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\"</td>
						<td>Double quote.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\n</td>
						<td>ASCII Linefeed, New line.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\r</td>
						<td>ASCII Carriage return</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\b</td>
						<td>ASCII Backspace.</td>

					<tr>
						<td>\t</td>
						<td>ASCII Horizontal tab.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\v</td>
						<td>ASCII Vertical tab.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>\a</td>
						<td>ASCII Bell.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<div class="code">var str = 'Fract with\nNew Line!'</div>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>
				The array structure, which is useful for holding multiple values, is offered by many programming languages.
				Once an array is defined, its size remains constant. Each element can be of a different data type.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var array = [1, 20., 'Fract', print]</div>
				An array is defined by writing the values ​​between the parentheses, separated by commas.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var array = [1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30]
print(array)
print(array[2])
array[2] = 200
print(array)

# OUTPUT
# [1 10 2 20 3 30]
# 2
# [1 10 200 20 3 30]</div>
				Array allows to get and set values ​​with the help of index.
				The index is specified as an integer in parentheses and access is provided.
				Index 0 represents the first element, and it continues to increase by one for each subsequent element.
				It is also possible to access elements in reverse with negative indexing.
				Negative indexing starts with -1 and continues to decrease one by one for each subsequent element.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var array = [1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30]
print(array[-2])

# OUTPUT: 3</div>
				The index -2 of the array defined above is equal to index 4 by reverse indexing.
				Since -1 represents the last index value, each decrease represents the index before it.
				In other words, -2 index allows you to get the second-to-last element.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="variables_and_mutability">Variables and Mutability</h2>
				Fract is immutable by default. This is one of the approaches to the safe and clean programming experience that Fract brings to you.
				However, this is not a requirement. You can optionally use it as a mutable. Variables are a convenient way to remember data and can take on various types of values. We mentioned this in data types.
				<div class="warn">
					<ul>
						<li>A value must be given when defining a variable.</li>
						<li>Variable names are must comply to naming conventions.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				The <x class="inline_code"> var </x> keyword used for declare variable.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var binary = [0, 1]</div>
				The <x class="inline_code"> var </x> keyword is immutable. If wants declare mutable variable, use <x class="inline_code"> mut </x> keyword.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">mut names = ['Adam', 'Clark', 'Claire']</div>
				You may want to create a variable whose value cannot be changed after it is defined.
				The <x class="inline_code"> const </x> keyword used for declare constant variable, is immutable and cannot set as mutable.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">const pi = 3.14</div>
				<div class="tip">
					Variable declarations can be provided by grouping.
					<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px">var (
    FibonacciFirst = 1
    Ln2Hi          = 6.93147180369123816490e-01
    Hex            = 0x07EDD5E59A4E28C2
)</div>
				</div>
				<h3>Setting Variables</h3>
				Defined variables can be changed later. There is a pretty easy way to do this. You write the new value you want to give after the name of the variable.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">var a = 45      # Value is 45
a = 1           # Value is 1</div>
				<h3>Why immutability?</h3>
				By default, mutable values ​​can cause undesirable results.
				Variable values ​​represent a reference when used directly, and the same value now has more than one delegate. This may cause you to change a value that you do not want to change.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var a = [1, 4, 8]
var b = a
b[2] = 10
print(a)
print(b)

# OUTPUT
# [1 4 8]
# [1 4 10]</div>
				Since it is immutable by default, there is no referencing case here.
				Variable <x class="inline_code"> b </x> takes the value of variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x> directly, it does not reference variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x>.
				Therefore, when the second index is changed on variable <x class="inline_code"> b </x>, this change is not reflected in variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x>.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">mut a = [1, 4, 8]
var b = a
b[2] = 10
print(a)
print(b)

# OUTPUT
# [1 4 10]
# [1 4 10]</div>
				When you create a variable as mutable, it now means that it is referenceable.
				Now variable <x class="inline_code"> b </x> takes the reference of variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x> instead of getting its value directly.
				Therefore, changes on <x class="inline_code"> b </x> are directly reflected on variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x>.
				In fact, you are changing variable <x class="inline_code"> a </x> by using variable <x class="inline_code"> b </x>.
				<div class="warn">
					An immutable variable that references a mutable variable, when given as a value to another variable, copies the value instead of giving a reference to the value it refers to.
					In order for it to reference, the reference variable must also be created as a mutable.
				</div>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="control_flow">Control Flow</h2>
				It is the building block of most programming languages ​​to repeatedly run or manipulate algorithms according to conditions.
				The most common expressions that will allow you to control the Fract code are if and loop expressions.
				<h3><x class="inline_code"> if </x> Expressions</h3>
				An if statement allows you to branch your code based on conditions. You provide a condition and then write the algorithm that will run if the condition is met.
				Optionally, you can also specify alternative conditions and situations where no conditions are met.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var n = 3
if n < 5
    print('condition is true')
end

# OUTPUT: condition is true</div>
				Each conditional statement begins with an <x class="inline_code"> if </x> by the condition.
				Then, the algorithm that will be realized if the condition is met is written into the block.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var n = 50
if n < 0
    print('n is negative')
elif n < 100
    print('n is less than 100')
end

# OUTPUT: n is less than 100</div>
				You can add <x class="inline_code"> elif </x> statements after the <x class="inline_code"> if </x> expression for alternative conditions.
				It specifies an alternative condition that works if the previous conditions are not met.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var n = 300
if n < 0
    print('n is negative')
elif n <= 100
    print('n is less than 100')
else
    print('n is greater than 100')
end

# OUTPUT: n is greater than 100</div>
				If you want to specify an algorithm that will run if no conditions are met, you can use the <x class="inline_code"> else </x> statement.
				This statement is written at the bottom and should be the last statement of the block.
				It works when no previous condition is met.
				<div class="tip">
					Preferably, you can also use 0 instead of false and 1 instead of true as the keyword true represents 1 and the keyword false represents 0.
				</div>
				<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
				It is useful to execute a block of code more than once. Fract provides various loops to do this.
				A loop repeatedly executes the code block inside it as the condition is met.
				<br>
				<br>
				Fract has two different cycles: <x class="inline_code"> foreach </x> and <x class="inline_code"> while </x> loops.
				<h4>While Loop</h4>
				While the condition is true, the loop runs.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var n = 0
for n < 10
    n += 1
    print(n, fin=' ')
end</div>
				The loop has a condition that will run as long as the variable <x class="inline_code"> n </x> is less than 10.
				During the loop, the variable <x class="inline_code"> n </x> is incremented at each iteration, when it reaches 10, the loop ends as the condition is no longer met.
				<div class="tip">The best way give an empty condition for infinite loop.</div>
				<h4>Foreach Loop</h4>
				You can loop through the elements of an array with a while loop.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var t1 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 90]
var i = 0
for i < 5
    print(t1[i])
    i += 1
end</div>
				As expected, this code will work correctly. The loop is set to rotate according to the length of the array and will print each element to the screen.
				However, this approach is error-prone and requires a lot of code modification.
				If the size of the known array changes in the future, this code will cause an error if its size is less than 5, and if it is large, it will print incompletely.
				So in any change the condition also needs to be updated, forgetting to change it will cause problems.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var t1 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 90]
for i in t1
    print(t1[i])
end</div>
				You can eliminate these situations with the <x class="inline_code"> foreach </x> loop.
				It adjusts itself according to the size of the array, and each element runs as a single repeat.
				Also, the code now looks cleaner and more readable.
				<br>
				<br>
				The first parameter of the loop always returns an index of current element.
				If you want to get the element itself, you can add a second parameter.
				If you don't need to use the index value, you can ignore it.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var t1 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 90]
for _, i in t1
    print(i)
end</div>
				The code now looks cleaner and performs better.
				When the element is accessed with index, the element is read again from the memory according to the index value, but when you add the element parameter, you do not need to do an extra reading as it will already be pulled from the memory.
				<h4>Loop Controlling</h4>
				In various situations you may want to manage loops such as ending loops or switching to other loop iterations and this is a very useful method that is widely used.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">var counter = 0
for counter <= 10
    counter = counter + 1
    if counter > 5
        break
    end
    print(counter, fin=' ')
end

# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5</div>
				With the keyword  <x class="inline_code"> break </x>, it is possible to override and terminate the entire loop even when the loop could still run.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">for _, item in [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.0 ]
    if item == 1 || item == 3
        continue
    end
    print(item, fin=' ')
end

# Output: 0, 2, 4</div>
				The keyword <x class="inline_code"> continue </x> is used to pass the loop to the next iteration.
				If there is no next loop iteration, the loop is finished.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
				Functions are very useful for adding functionality to your code, functions are very common in Fract code.
				Functions are declared with the <x class="inline_code"> func </x> keyword.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func helloWorld()
    print('Hello World!')
end

helloWorld()</div>
				This code is a simple function declaration. It can be called without parameters and write "Hello World!".
				<br>
				<br>
				Functions can also be defined to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature.
				When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters.
				<div class="warn">If a parameter is equal to a different definition name, it will replace that definition.</div>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func sum(a, b)
    print(a + b)
end

sum(5, 4)

# OUTPUT: 9</div>
				The above function takes two values, sums them up and writes them to the screen.
				Since the values ​​given as arguments are <x class="inline_code"> 5 </x> and <x class="inline_code"> 4 </x>, the <x class="inline_code"> a </x> parameter is <x class="inline_code"> 5 </x> and the <x class="inline_code"> b </x> parameter is <x class="inline_code"> 4 </x>, respectively.
				<br>
				<br>
				A parameter can take a default value. Parameters that take a default value do not have to take a value.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func sum(a, b=90)
    print(a + b)
end

sum(5)
sum(2, 10)

# OUTPUT
# 95
# 5.0</div>
				Although no value was specified during the first call, <x class="inline_code"> 90 </x> was given instead of the <x class="inline_code"> b </x> parameter, which defaults to <x class="inline_code"> 90 </x>.
				Because a custom value was specified in the next call, the value <x class="inline_code"> 90 </x> was overridden and the value of the argument became <x class="inline_code"> 10 </x>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Arguments can also be specified as names and their order can be ignored.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func divide(a, b, c)
    print((a + b) / c)
end

divide(c=9, a=5, b=0)
divide(2, c=10, b=0)

# OUTPUT
# 0.5555555556
# 0.2</div>
				After an argument is specified by name, all subsequent arguments must also be specified by name.
				In the first call, all the arguments were specified in different order by name and received their values.
				In the second call, the first argument is not specified with a name.
				All values ​​until specified by name are assigned to the arguments in order, like a regular call.
				<br>
				<br>
				A parameter can be used with the <x class="inline_code"> ... </x> operator so that it can take multiple values. In this way, the parameter will take all values ​​as an array.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func params(...a, ...b=[])
    var r = 0
    for _, n in a
        r += n
    end
    for _, n in b
        r += n
    end
    print(r)
end

params(100, 110, 120)
params(1, 4, 2, 6, b=0, 2, 5, 10)

# OUTPUT
# 330
# 30</div>
				The code above has a function with two more than one parameter, and this function finds the total values ​​of the parameters, adds them together and prints them out.
				The first call assigns all values ​​to parameter <x class="inline_code"> a </x>, parameter <x class="inline_code"> b </x> remains its default value, the empty array.
				If a parameter that can take multiple values ​​is followed by another parameter, it must be specified with its name.
				As was done in the second call, the <x class="inline_code"> a </x> and <x class="inline_code"> b </x> parameters now have special values.
				<br>
				<br>
				Functions can also return a value.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">func asHello(name)
    ret 'Hello ' + name + '!'
end

print(asHello('Fract'))

# OUTPUT: Hello Fract!</div>
				The above function converts the value given to it to a hello message and returns it as a value.
				The <x class="inline_code"> ret </x> keyword is used to return a value.
				When the function returns a value, the function returns the value and stops executing, if there is any code that follows it, they will never be reached.


				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="error_handling">Error Handling</h2>
				In some cases, Fract code may panic, preventing current code execution.
				Catching errors and handling them on a case-by-case basis is an approach offered by many programming languages.
				Error catching in Fract is done with try-catch blocks.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">try
    var arr = [1, 2, 3, 10, 341, 0]
    print(arr[6]) # Out of range.
catch
    print('Panic!')
end</div>
				You write the codes you want to debug in the try block, in case of a panic, the catch block will run.
				<div class="tip" style="margin-top: 5px;">
					If you don't want use catch blocks, you can use only try block.
				</div>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="macro_control_flow">Macro Control Flow</h2>
				Macros can be quite useful in places.
				They allow you to manipulate code based on certain conditions, but this is different from <x class="inline_code"> if </x> expressions.
				The codes inside <x class="inline_code"> if </x> expressions are invalid outside those blocks, so if you define a variable inside, you will not be able to use this variable outside the block.
				Macros don't count as a block, what they do is shape and structure code with conditions.
				<br>
				<br>
				Variables in the code cannot be used in macros, the default macro variables are used.
				<ul>
					<li>OS</li>
					Operating system name. Possible values: <x class="inline_code"> darwin </x>, <x class="inline_code"> windows </x>, <x class="inline_code"> linux </x>.
					<li>ARC</li>
					Architecture. Possible values: <x class="inline_code"> 386 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> amd64 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> amd64p32 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> arm </x>, <x class="inline_code"> arm64 </x>,
					<x class="inline_code"> ppc64 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> ppc64le </x>, <x class="inline_code"> mips </x>, <x class="inline_code"> mipsle </x>, <x class="inline_code"> mips64 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> mips64le </x>,
					<x class="inline_code"> mips64p32le </x>, <x class="inline_code"> ppc </x>, <x class="inline_code"> s390 </x>, <x class="inline_code"> s390x </x>, <x class="inline_code"> sparc </x>, <x class="inline_code"> sparc64 </x>.
				</ul>
				<div class="code" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">#if OS == 'windows'
    const sz = 30
#elif OS == 'darwin'
    const sz = 35
#else
    print('ERROR: Invalid operating system!')
    exit(1)
#end

print(sz)</div>
				The code here gives the value 30 to the constant variable named <x class="inline_code"> sz </x> if the operating system is windows, and the value 35 for darwin and prints it.
				If it's not windows or darwin it prints an error message and exit.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="pragmas">Pragmas</h2>
				Pragmas are used to manipulate the interpreter. This may be needed from time to time.
				<ul>
					<li>enofi</li>
					This pragma ignores the rest from where it was written during import and does not import.
				</ul>
				<div class="code" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">const Token = '938493enmnlfm3o5305m36390öfd903fö390jm3t6'
#pragma enofi
const Code = '49R-er34-TGH'</div>
				When importing this code, it takes the <x class="inline_code"> Token </x> definition but excludes the <x class="inline_code"> Code </x> definition.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="deferred_calls">Deferred Calls</h2>
				A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the block ends.
				The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the block end.
				<div class="warn">
					<ul>
						Each of these is assumed as an independent block for defer;
						<br>
						<br>
						<li>Main program body</li>
						<li>Try-Catch body</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">defer print('world')
print('hello')

# OUTPUT
# hello
# world</div>
				The "hello" is printed first because "world!" the print process waits for the block to finish before being called.

				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">print('counting')

				Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

				<h2 id="memory_management">Memory Management</h2>
				Memory management is handled automatically by the garbage collector within Fract.
				Technically, Fract does not offer complete memory management, but it does allow you to manually delete definitions in memory.
				The <x class="inline_code"> delete </x> keyword is used to delete from memory.
				The names of the definitions to be deleted from the memory are written, you can separate more than one definition with a comma to delete it at the same time.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px;">var (
    a = 0
    b = 0
)
del a, b         # Remove 'a' and 'b' variables from memory
                 # No defined variables</div>
				<h3>Protected Definitions</h3>
				If you're making a library or something different, there might be a definition you don't want to be erased from memory.
				To specify this, you can prevent it from being deleted manually with the <x class="inline_code"> protected </x> keyword.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">protected var example = 4
del var</div>
				This code will throw an error because the variable you are trying to delete is a protected variable.

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 id="contains_checking">Contains Checking</h2>
				Often times, it may be necessary to quickly check the value.
				Checking whether there is a value in it is one of them, Fract has an approach that provides convenience in this regard.
				With the <x class="inline_code"> in </x> keyword, it is also possible to check values ​​inside enumerable values.
				The value on the left is searched within the value on the right.
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">if 'urk' in 'Turkey'
    print('Yes!')
else
    print('No!')
end

# OUTPUT: Yes!</div>
				In this code, the value on the left is a string value. The value on the right must also be a string.
				It is case sensitive and will return true if the value is in it and false otherwise.
				Since <x class="inline_code"> urk </x> value is in <x class="inline_code"> Turkey </x>, it returns true.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">if ['Hola', 'Bojour', 'Selam', 'Hello'] in 'Hi'
    print('Yes!')
else
    print('No!')
end

# OUTPUT: No!</div>
				An array can be given if it wants to be checked with more than one value. All elements of Array must be strings.
				Since there is no value equal to or containing any value in the array in this code, the result is evaluated as false.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">if 4 in [4, 2, 7]
    print('Yes!')
else
    print('No!')
end

# OUTPUT: Yes!</div>
				The left value can be a string, the value given on the right is compared with its elements of array and evaluates to true if it is equal to any of its elements, false otherwise.
				In the code <x class="inline_code"> 4 </x> returns true because it exists in the given array.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="code" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">if [4, 'Fract'] in [4, 2, [4, 'Fract'], 7]
    print('Yes!')
else
    print('No!')
end

# OUTPUT: Yes!</div>
			When the left value is an array, the value of the other side is searched directly in it, as with string values, when the right value is an array, it does not scroll through all its elements.
			<x class="inline_code"> [4, 'Fract'] </x> evaluates to true because it is contained in the given array.
			The order of the elements makes a difference in the comparison, if the value was <x class="inline_code"> ['Fract', 4] </x> the evaluation would result in false.
